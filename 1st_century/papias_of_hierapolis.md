# Overview

> Papias (Greek: Παπίας) was a Greek Apostolic Father, Bishop of Hierapolis (modern Pamukkale, Turkey), and author who lived c. 60 – c. 130 AD. He wrote the *Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord* (Greek: Λογίων Κυριακῶν Ἐξήγησις) in five books. This work, which is lost apart from brief excerpts in the works of [Irenaeus of Lyons](/2nd_century/irenaeus_of_lyons) (c. 180) and [Eusebius of Caesarea](/3rd_century/eusebius_of_caesarea) (c. 320), is an important early source on Christian oral tradition and especially on the origins of the canonical Gospels. [^wikipedia]

# Theology

Papias seems to have offered little to the Church in terms of new theological ideas. Rather, the writings that have come down (mostly by others like [Irenaeus](/2nd_century/irenaeus_of_lyons) and [Eusebius](/3rd_century/eusebius_of_caesarea) quoting him) provided early insights into the formation and sourcing of the gospels. His association (noted by [Irenaeus](/2nd_century/irenaeus_of_lyons)) with John (the apostle? the presbyter? the evangelist?) [^fn_john] and [Polycarp](/1st_century/polycarp) places him remarkably close to the first apostles. [^anf1_563]

# Personal Insights from Study

[Eusebius](/3rd_century/eusebius_of_caesarea) notes that Papias (having heard this from John "the presbyter") that the author of Mark, "the interpreter of Peter" wrote down Peter's stories of Christ and translated them into Greek. This may account for why the writings appear disorganized. [^anf2_1]

[Eusebius](/3rd_century/eusebius_of_caesarea) also notes that Matthew originally wrote in the Hebrew Language. The editors of the volume, however, caution that this one note might or might not apply to the Gospel of Matthew itself, but to other writings. [^anf2_1]
