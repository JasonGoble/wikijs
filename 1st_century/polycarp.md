# Overview

> Polycarp (/ˈpɒlikɑːrp/; Greek: Πολύκαρπος, Polýkarpos; Latin: Polycarpus; AD 69 – 155) was a Christian bishop of Smyrna. According to the *Martyrdom of Polycarp*, he died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body. Polycarp is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches.
>
> Both Irenaeus and Tertullian say that Polycarp had been a disciple of John the Apostle, one of Jesus' disciples. In *On Illustrious Men*, Jerome writes that Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle and that John had ordained him as a bishop of Smyrna. Polycarp is regarded as one of three chief Apostolic Fathers, along with Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch. [^wikipedia]

> Polycarp likely lived during the time of some of the 12 apostles and then served as a church leader to the post-apostolic church through the first half of the second century. During his church service, he wrote a letter to the same Philippian church that Paul addressed; he even wrote in the same genre as the New Testament letters, using New Testament texts in the process. [^LBD]

# Theology

Theologically, Polycarp staunchly defended orthodox teaching - presumably handed down to him by the Apostle John (or Paul).[^LBD] The oxford dictionary notes that he was "[a] staunch defender of orthodoxy, he devoted much of his energy to combating such heretics as the Marcionites and Valentinians."

  - "Polycarp’s *Letter to the Philippians* (Pol. Phil) is one of the earliest surviving, nonbiblical writings of the church. In this letter, Polycarp is concerned with advising the Christians at Philippi to remain faithful to Christ in their beliefs and practices." [^LBD]
- [The Encyclical Epistle of the Church at Smyrna -*or*- the Martyrdom of Polycarp](https://ref.ly/logosres/anfrc01?ref=ApostolicFathers.MPoly) [^ANF-CE1]
  - "The *Martyrdom of Polycarp* (Mart. Pol.) is a letter composed by the church of Smyrna shortly after Polycarp’s death and sent to the church at Philomelium. It may be the earliest known work of martyrology (an account devoted almost entirely to describing the suffering of a martyr)." [^LBD]
