# Overview

> Ignatius of Antioch (/ɪɡˈneɪʃəs/; Greek: Ἰγνάτιος Ἀντιοχείας, *Ignátios Antiokheías*; died c. 108/140 AD), also known as Ignatius Theophorus (Ἰγνάτιος ὁ Θεοφόρος, *Ignátios ho Theophóros*, lit. “the God-bearing”), was an early Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch. While en route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters. This correspondence now forms a central part of a later collection of works known to be authored by the Apostolic Fathers. He is considered to be one of the three most important of these, together with [Clement of Rome](/1st_century/clement_of_rome) and [Polycarp](/1st_century/polycarp). His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology. Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops. [^wikipedia]

> While stopped at Smyrna, Ignatius wrote four letters to the churches of the Ephesians, Trallians, Magnesians, and Romans, followed by three letters from Troas to Polycarp, the Smyrnaeans, and the Philadelphians. &#8230; In these letters, Ignatius focused on three primary concerns: the church’s unity and the bishop’s importance for that unity, the problem of heresy, and enlisting the believers’ assistance in his martyrdom. [^eldch]

# Theology
## Christology
> \[A\]cross all these themes \[(church unity and bishops' importance, heresy, and assistance in martyrdom)\] one theme supports them all—Ignatius’s focus on the atoning work of Christ on the cross. This focus on the cross or crucicentrism is found in varying degrees across all seven of his letters, and it provided the reason for everything that Ignatius wrote to the churches. For Ignatius, the cross of Christ was a historical reality that fundamentally altered everything, and he highlighted four ways in which Christians benefit from Christ’s death. The first and most significant benefit of the cross was the salvation available to all men through Christ’s atoning death. A second benefit was the abolition of death and the promise of eternal life. This benefit is similar to the previous one but focused on the results of salvation rather than salvation proper. Third, a focus on Christ’s death encouraged believers amid suffering. Just as Christ suffered, so also believers will suffer. Yet Christ did not avoid suffering but instead endured it for the sake of his people. The final benefit was an incomparable joy through fellowship with Christ. This crucicentrism encouraged Ignatius to hold fast to his call to martyrdom, and church tradition holds that Ignatius eventually came to Rome and was there martyred for his faith. [^eldch]

> The Christology of Ignatius has been called "a high Christology of Johannine inspiration." Actually Ignatius moves one step further in heightening Christology than anything in the NT. Although the NT is replete with statements of the lordship and divinity of Jesus Christ, nowhere is Jesus precisely identified as being God. Ignatius makes this identification 11 times, beginning in the very salutation of his first letter, Ephesians, which refers to "Jesus Christ our God." Yet his Christology is in no way docetic. In Smyrn. 2.2 he refers to Jesus as "truly nailed for us in the flesh." The virgin birth and the Resurrection are important for Ignatius, but the Crucifixion is paramount. Nevertheless, he scarcely alludes to the teachings of Jesus and the events of his ministry. [^edb]

## Ecclesiology
> The ecclesiology of Ignatius also represents a development beyond the NT. The apostles were the leaders of the earliest Church, with prophets and teachers and other spiritually gifted people forming lower ranks of leadership (1 Cor. 12:28). The deaths of the apostles usher in a new twofold church order of the offices of bishops and deacons. We see this church order in 1 Timothy and in 1 Clement and the Shepherd of Hermas in the Apostolic Fathers. Ignatius evidences movement to a threefold church order which will become the norm, of bishops, elders, and deacons. Ignatius particularly extols the office of bishop and in every letter except Romans exhorts his readers to obey the bishop. In Eph. 6.1 he says that “one must look upon the bishop as the Lord himself” and in Magn. 6.1 he says that the bishop presides in the place of God. Ignatius extols the partaking of the eucharist, though he does not speak of Christian baptism. He also notes that Christians no longer keep the sabbath (Saturday) but now celebrate the Lord’s Day (Sunday). [^edb]

## Martyrdom
> Ignatius also goes beyond the NT in his development of a theology of martyrdom. His imagery of martyrdom, especially in Rom. 4–5, advances far beyond anything in the NT and points toward the theology of martyrdom that will motivate Christians through the next two centuries of Roman persecution. He himself genuinely longs for martyrdom, which he sees as true discipleship and a means to “attain to God” (Rom. 4.1). Ignatius received his wish in Rome toward the end of the reign of Trajan.

# Quotes
> Labor together with one another, compete together, run together, suffer together, die together, rise up together, as God’s managers and assistants and servants. Please the one whom you serve as a soldier, from whom you also receive wages. Let none of you be found a deserter. Keep your baptism as weaponry, your faith as a helmet, your love as a spear, your endurance as a full set of armor. Let your works be your war-time deposits, so that you may receive your deserved savings. Be patient, therefore, with one another, in gentleness, as God is with you. (Ignatius to the Ephesians, 6.1-2)

> But you also pray unceasingly on behalf of others, for there is in them a hope of repentance that they may find God. Therefore allow them at least by your deeds, to be disciples. In response to their anger, your gentleness; in response to their arrogant rhetoric, your humility; in response to their abusive speech, your prayer, in response to their deception, your steadfast faithfulness; in response to their violence, your gentleness; not being eager to imitate them. Let us be found to be by gentleness their brothers and sisters, and let us be eager to be imitators of the Lord. (Ignatius to the Ephesians, 10.1-3)

> Flee from the evil arts; instead preach a sermon about them. (Ignatius to Polycarp, 5.1)

> Wherever Jesus Christ is, the catholic church is there. (Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans, 8.2)
